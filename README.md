# F1ssi0N 2015 LoadLibrary injector
A very simple load library injector
I used this injector myself from early 2015 right up until December of last year - never VAC banned.

### Releases can be found below the project discription - to the left of the `clone or download` button and up

Not too dissimilar from GameOwner - this injector is simple:
 - No gui
 - No manual mapping
 - No process title (making the process title the filename)
 
If you are building from scratch make sure to change the configuration to Release|x86
 
You can either use the injector in `Interactive mode` where you can enter the dll name and process name or create a batch file to do it for you - help is displayed when you run the program with no arguments.

## Some other notes that I feel make this injector better than GameOwner
 - GameOwner is tried and tested - a good 3 years without being detected however, this injector is open source. Change what you want - re-release this with your own name.
 - The program only waits for a keypress on exit if there is an error and only asks for input if you do not specify a process name and dll name. For me this is one of the problems with Gameowner - it is simply not fast enough
 - Not having to carry around a `.ini` library helps to make this injector less than half the size of GameOwner.
